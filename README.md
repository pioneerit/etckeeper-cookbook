Attributes
==========
```ruby
default['etckeeper']['git_host'] = "github.com"
default['etckeeper']['git_port'] = "22"
default['etckeeper']['git_repo'] = "etckeeper"
default['etckeeper']['git_branch'] = node['fqdn']

default['etckeeper']['config_file']['AVOID_SPECIAL_FILE_WARNING'] = 1
default['etckeeper']['config_file']['AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL'] = 1

```

Usage
=====
* Add to run_list `recipe['etckeeper']` for local using etckeeper
* Set either ['git_host']`, ['git_repo'] or ['git_port'] for daily auto push to remote:
 * Make ssh key and copy to `./files/default/etckeeper_key` or create a wrapper cookbook with the ssh key you want to deploy then set following attribute: `node['etckeeper']['ssh']['key']['cookbook']`
 * Set your `git_host` and `git_port` if your need
 * Set at atribute for git repo. For example github repo `default['etckeeper']['git_repo'] = "myuser/myrepo.git"`

Etckeeper::Commit
=================

This recipe will do two things

* In the beginning of the chef-run, check if `/etc` is unclean. If yes, fail the chef-run.
* After the chef-run, a report handler will commit the changes made to `/etc` during this chef-run.
